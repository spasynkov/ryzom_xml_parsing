# Ryzom API XML parsing
[Ryzom] (http://ryzom.com) - is mmorpg game with lots of players from all around the world.<br />
[Ryzom API] (http://app.ryzom.com/app_ryzomapi/index.php) gives an information about some character in XML like view.<br />
I'm trying to parse that XML, create object view of information from such XML file and make some tools for better organizing, sorting and view of character's info.
